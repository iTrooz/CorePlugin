A light version of CorePlugin, a plugin of Entasia. This fork is made to be able to run on servers without problem, and without pieces of code specific to Entasia.

Needs https://github.com/iTrooz/Libraries to work (not EntasiaOfficiel's Libraries)


- Supports 1.15-1.16 (support in issues)
- Should support 1.9-1.12 (support in issues)
- DOESN'T support 1.8 (no support, go away you dinosaur)
